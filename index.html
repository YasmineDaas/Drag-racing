			<p class="intro">"We almost got killed." This is what David Lengel's wife told him on the phone minutes after she left their home in Bay Ridge with their son when a car cut them off in the street. "I wake up at least a few times weekly because of the noise," said Maggie Kruk, another Bay Ridge resident.

				Residents of Bay Ridge have been complaining about the loud racing car culture which seems to be growing in the last few years and raising safety concerns. According to <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/p5f6-bkga/visualization"> 311 NYC Open Data </a>, there was a sharp rise in the number of vehicle noise complaints in Bay Ridge from 2020.

				"It started since the pandemic. It's a real quality of life and public safety concern," said District Manager of Community Board 10 Josephine Beckmann. "As a community board, we advocate on behalf of the residents to the responsible enforcement agencies, as well as our elected officials who can change the law."

            <p>
				To combat illegal car modifications and noise pollution, Governor Kathy Hochul <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-signs-legislation-cracking-down-noisy-illegal-mufflers-and-exhaust-systems"> signed a law </a> on Oct. 29, 2021, that increased penalties against motorists and the repair shops performing the modifications.
			</p>
            <p>
				However, residents still feel unsafe as if nothing has changed since the law was passed. "The police aren't very active," said Monzeglio. "It feels like there are no consequences."
